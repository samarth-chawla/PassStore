        PassStore is a simple password manager application created by a learner for practice purposes. 
        This app securely stores your passwords locally in your browser's <span className="font-semibold">localStorage</span>.
        It does not currently have a backend connection, which means your data remains only on your device.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the future, the app will be upgraded to include backend connectivity, providing additional features like 
        cloud synchronization, advanced encryption, and multi-device access.
